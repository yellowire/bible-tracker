# bible-tracker
Android app for setting Bible reading goals & tracking progress.


## Installation
To install the app on an Android device, you'll need to download the `.apk` file to your device. The `.apk` file can be found in the current master branch at `/Releases/BibleTrackerv*.apk`, or in the latest release. Once downloaded, select the APK on your device to install. When prompted, confirm that you'd like to install from unknown source (i.e. one that hasn't registered with Google, i.e. me). 


## Code edits
The source code is available for downloading & editing in the `BibleTracker` directory in master root. If you'd like to make a pull request, or just play around with the code, do it! Any comments or advice is very welcome. 


## Bugs and Suggestions
If the app doesn't work the way it ought to, or you feel it could be made better if it functioned differently, please let me know! Please submit an issue on Github describing the needed or hoped-for change so I can care for it efficiently. 


## Thanks for trying it out!
Testing is probably the absolute worst part of developing anything, so the more people there are looking for ways to break things, the easier it is for me to improve upon the project. Thanks for taking a look!
